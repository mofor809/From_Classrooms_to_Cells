"Note: ""Economically Disadvantaged Students"" come from families whose income is within 185 percent of the federal poverty line. The District formerly referred to these students as ""Free or Reduced Lunch Eligible Students,"" and adopted the new term after the federal government, under the Community Eligibility Provision, funded breakfasts and lunches for all students if more than 40 percent of students qualify. ",,,,,,,,,
